# Step 5: How to Write Blog Posts?

Jekyll automatically generates a blog from Markdown (.md) files stored in the `_posts/` folder. You just need to follow a specific format.

1. Write a New Blog Post. Each post should be a Markdown file inside _posts/, and its filename must follow this format:

        _posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md
2. Structure of a Blog Post. Each post must start with front matter (YAML at the top), followed by content. Example: `_posts/2025-03-24-my-first-post.md`
